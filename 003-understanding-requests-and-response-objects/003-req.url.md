## What is req.url

### 1. What Is `req.url`? 

When a client sends a request to a server, it must answer this question:

**“Where is this request going?”**

That **destination** is called the **URL**.

In Express, this information is available as:

- `req.url`

In very simple words:

- **`req.url` = the exact path the client requested**

---

### 2. What Is a URL? 

A full URL looks like this:

    http://localhost:3000/products?page=1&sort=price

This URL has multiple parts, but for now focus on this:

- `/products?page=1&sort=price`

That entire part is what Express exposes as:

- `req.url`

---

### 3. Big Picture Mental Model

Think of an HTTP request like this:

    REQUEST  
    │  
    ├── Method  → GET / POST  
    ├── URL     → WHERE the request is going  
    ├── Headers → Extra info  
    └── Body    → Data  

So:

- Method = what to do
- URL = where to do it

---

### 4. First Simple Example

Express code:

    app.get("/", (req, res) => {
      console.log(req.url);
      res.send("Check terminal");
    });

Steps:

1. Run server
2. Open browser: `http://localhost:3000`
3. Check terminal

Output:

    /

Why?

- `/` is the **root path**
- Visiting the home page means requesting `/`

---

### 5. Trying Another Path

Add another route:

    app.get("/users", (req, res) => {
      console.log(req.url);
      res.send("Users page");
    });

Now open:

    http://localhost:3000/users

Terminal output:

    /users

This proves:

- `req.url` shows the path that was requested

---

### 6. Important Beginner Clarification 

`req.url` includes:

- ✅ Path
- ✅ Query string (if present)

Example request:

    http://localhost:3000/products?category=books&page=2

`req.url` will be:

    /products?category=books&page=2

This is **very important**.

---

### 7. Path vs Query 

From the URL:

    /products?category=books&page=2

- Path = `/products`
- Query string = `?category=books&page=2`

But `req.url` gives you **both together**.

Later, Express provides helpers like:

- `req.path`
- `req.query`

But at the raw level:

- `req.url` = full requested URL part

---

### 8. Why Does the Server Care About URLs?

Because different URLs usually mean:

- Different resources
- Different logic
- Different data

Examples:

- `/users` → users data
- `/products` → products data
- `/orders/123` → order with ID 123

Without URLs:

- Every request would hit the same logic
- ❌ Chaos

---

### 9. How Express Uses URLs Internally

When you write:

    app.get("/users", handler)

Express internally checks:

- Does `req.method === "GET"`?
- Does `req.url` start with `/users`?

If yes:

- Run the handler

If no:

- Try the next route

This is why exact paths matter.

---

### 10. Common Beginner Confusion 

❌ Thinking `req.url` is only the route you defined

Example mistake:

- Route: `/products`
- URL visited: `/products?page=1`

Beginner expectation:

- req.url === `/products`

Reality:

- req.url === `/products?page=1`

This is correct behavior.

---

### 11. Real-World Analogy 

Think of a large apartment building:

- Building = server
- Floor numbers = routes
- Apartment number = URL

`req.url` tells you:

- Exactly which door the user knocked on

---

### 12. When You Should Use `req.url` Directly 

In real Express apps, you rarely parse `req.url` manually.

Why?

- Express gives you cleaner tools:
  - `req.params`
  - `req.query`
  - `req.path`

But understanding `req.url` helps you:

- Debug routing issues
- Understand middleware
- Read low-level logs
- Learn how frameworks work internally

---

### 13. Tiny Experiment 

Try this:

    app.get("/test", (req, res) => {
      console.log(req.url);
      res.send("Logged URL");
    });

Open:

    http://localhost:3000/test?x=10&y=20

Terminal output:

    /test?x=10&y=20

This confirms everything you learned.

---

### 14. Minimal Mental Model 

If you remember one sentence:

**`req.url` tells you WHERE the client is going**

- Method → what
- URL → where
